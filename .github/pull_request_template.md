What is the new behavior?
i.e. Added a button to do the thing and also handled edge-cases
What else was added outside of the scope of the ask?
i.e. Simple bugfix, corrected typos, cleaned up code, etc
Do ANY of these changes introduce a breaking change? (in-scope or otherwise)
i.e. Users need to update their .env files with the following... etc
Manual test cases?
i.e. ignoring the button and clicking on the "NEXT" button should trigger a warning event because the thing that clicking the new button does didn't happen
